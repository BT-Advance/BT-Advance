    👋 Hi, I’m @BT-Advance

    👀 I’m interested in providing high-quality translation and localization services for businesses worldwide.

    🌱 I’m currently learning about emerging technologies in the translation industry and honing our expertise in specialized fields such as legal, medical, and technical translation.

    💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on multilingual projects that require precision, cultural sensitivity, and quick turnaround times.

    📫 How to reach me: You can contact us through our website at www.advance-mk.pl or via email at wycena@advance-mk.pl.

    😄 Pronouns: We prefer to use "we" or "our" as we are a team of dedicated translators and linguists.

    ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that our team collectively speaks over 30 languages fluently? We're truly passionate about breaking down language barriers and fostering global communication!
